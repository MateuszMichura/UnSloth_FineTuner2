# LLM Finetuner Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

The LLM Finetuner is a user-friendly application designed to simplify the process of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Unsloth library. The application provides a graphical user interface for dataset preparation, model selection, fine-tuning, testing, and GGUF conversion.

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 User Interface (ui.py)
- Gradio-based interface with tabs for different functionalities
- Handles user inputs and interactions
- Coordinates between different modules

### 3.2 Model Utilities (model_utils.py)
- Handles model loading and initialization
- Supports various pre-trained models from Unsloth

### 3.3 Dataset Utilities (dataset_utils.py)
- Manages dataset preparation from Hugging Face and local files
- Implements synthetic dataset creation using AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)

### 3.4 Training Utilities (training_utils.py)
- Implements the fine-tuning process using Unsloth and TRL

### 3.5 Inference Utilities (inference_utils.py)
- Handles model testing and inference

### 3.6 GGUF Conversion Utilities (gguf_utils.py)
- Manages the conversion of fine-tuned models to GGUF format

## 4. Implementation Plan

- Conduct usability testing with potential users
- Gather feedback on UI intuitiveness and feature completeness

## 6. Deployment Plan

### 6.1 Local Deployment
- Provide clear instructions for local installation and setup
- Create a comprehensive README with usage guidelines

### 6.2 Cloud Deployment (Future Consideration)
- Explore options for cloud deployment (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces, Google Cloud)
- Implement necessary security measures for cloud deployment

## 7. Documentation

- Create user documentation explaining each feature and its usage
- Develop technical documentation for future maintainers
- Include examples and use cases in the documentation

## 8. Maintenance and Updates

- Establish a process for regular updates to supported models and libraries
- Plan for ongoing bug fixes and feature enhancements based on user feedback


This project plan provides a roadmap for the development, testing, and deployment of the LLM Finetuner application. It should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project progresses and new requirements or challenges emerge.
